These are slides I used for a weekend course (12 hours) on
Intro to Web Development. Since the human brain (at least mine) can only
absorb so much information in a day, my strategy was to send the students
home with lots of documented examples, in the hopes that if they ever
found the time to go back and review their notes, the 
examples would hopefully look somewhat familiar and make some sense.

NOTE: You might need to download the PDFs in order to view them.
