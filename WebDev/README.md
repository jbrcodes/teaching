These are slides I used for a weekend course (12 hours) on
Intro to Web Development. Since the human brain can only
absorb so much information in a day, I sent the students
home with lots of examples, in the hopes that if they ever
find the time to go back and review their notes, the 
examples will hopefully look somewhat familiar and make some sense.
